# Data-Mining

R1: Choose a dataset and from there the topic, direction and questions we will ask. Needs to be complete asap so we can get started.

R2: Analyse the datasets, clean them up if need be and explore whats within.

R3 Cluster the data so we can show particular aspects of the data that carries similar characteristics.

R4: Apply the decision tree algorithms to build predictive models. Evaluatre how accurate and interpretable these are.

R5: Implement neural network models, including CNNs, for classification and regression.

Dataset chosen: https://huggingface.co/datasets/stingning/ultrachat

Current task (week 5): Attempt to load in and analyse the dataset
