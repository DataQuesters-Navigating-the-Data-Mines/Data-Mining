# Data-Mining

R1: Choose a dataset and from there the topic, direction and questions we will ask. Needs to be complete asap so we can get started.

R2: Analyse the datasets, clean them up if need be and explore whats within.

R3 Cluster the data so we can show particular aspects of the data that carries similar characteristics.

R4: Apply the decision tree algorithms to build predictive models. Evaluatre how accurate and interpretable these are.

R5: Implement neural network models, including CNNs, for classification and regression.

Current task (EOD Thursday 12/10): Each member select a dataset, then we vote on which to use.

Ross Update: 08/11/2023: Seemingly nothing done for the last few weeks while I've been unavailable?

Further update: Pravek and Ross will work on getting the data set loaded by next wednesday, preferably sooner. Rest of group still out of contact.

Syed Sharib update: I have uploaded the raw dataset and the selected dataset and created a new branch with the same name. I have also preprocessed the data so i have created another branch with the name and I will upload the preprocessed dataset in it in a few minutes.

After Detailed Discussion with the Syed Sharib, i have added the R1 of the Project, on the bases of our Data Set selection. all the questions, assumptions, and Hypothesis have been finalized.

Applied K-mean clustring on a demo dataset waiting for final copy of dataset from Sharib.

Syed Sharib update: I have uploaded the final copy of the dataset and also performed the preprocessing and exploratory data analysis on the dataset. Now for further steps, use the Data Mining R1 file as a prerequisite as it contains the codes for preprocessing and cleaning of the data.
